# Weather_App-java-Swing
A weather forecast app using Java Swing and JSON. (no test)
My fist app in java (netBeans)  using Swing. We fetch API and take the  Location and Curent and hourly forecast.
We have such classes as Localita, GestoreAPI, PrevAttuale, PrevOraria, PrevisioneMeteo  that is abstract class. 
--We have 3 forms :--
1. searchPage form contains label to insert a city and when the button is pressed passes to another form that in our case is formPrevAttuale 
2. formPrevAttuale  shows the current forecast we have a button to return to the searchPage and button to go to another form to show formPrevOraria
3. formPrevisioneOraria shows the  forecast hourly.

####it's my first project in java using API
